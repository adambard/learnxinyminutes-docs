R is a statistical computing language. It has lots of libraries for uploading and cleaning data sets, running statistical procedures, and making graphs. You can also run `R`commands within a LaTeX document.

# You can't make a multi-line comment per se,
# but you can stack multiple comments like so.

# VARIABLES

# Lots of way to assign stuff

y <- "1" # this is preferred
TRUE -> z # this works but is weird

# We can use coerce variables to different classes
as.numeric(y)	# 1

# LOOPS

# We've got for loops

# We've got while loops

while (a > 4) {
	cat(a, "...", sep = "")

# Keep in mind that for and while loops run slowly in R
# Operations on entire vectors (i.e. a whole row, a whole column)
# or apply()-type functions (we'll discuss later) are preferred

# IF/ELSE

# Again, pretty standard

# FUNCTIONS

# Defined like so:
jiggle <- function(x) {
	x = x + rnorm(1, sd=.1)	#add in a bit of (controlled) noise
	return(x)
}

# Called like any other R function:
jiggle(5)	# 5±ε. After set.seed(2716057), jiggle(5)==5.005043

#########################
# Fun with data: vectors, matrices, data frames, and arrays
#########################

# ONE-DIMENSIONAL

# You can vectorize anything, so long as all components have the same type
vec <- c(8, 9, 10, 11)
vec	#  8  9 10 11
# The class of a vector is the class of its components
class(vec)	# "numeric"
# If you vectorize items of different classes, weird coercions happen
c(TRUE, 4)	# 1 4
c("dog", TRUE, 4)	# "dog"  "TRUE" "4"

# We ask for specific components like so (R starts counting from 1)
vec[1]	# 8
# We can also search for the indices of specific components,
which(vec %% 2 == 0)	# 1 3
# or grab just the first or last entry in the vector
head(vec, 1)	# 8
tail(vec, 1)	# 11
# If an index "goes over" you'll get NA:
vec[6]	# NA
# You can find the length of your vector with length()
length(vec)	# 4

# You can perform operations on entire vectors or subsets of vectors
vec * 4	# 16 20 24 28
vec[2:3] * 5	# 25 30
# and there are many built-in functions to summarize vectors
mean(vec)	# 9.5
var(vec)	# 1.666667
sd(vec)	# 1.290994
max(vec)	# 11
min(vec)	# 8
sum(vec)	# 38

# TWO-DIMENSIONAL (ALL ONE CLASS)

# You can make a matrix out of entries all of the same type like so:
mat <- matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 2, c(1,2,3,4,5,6))
mat
# =>
#      [,1] [,2]
# [1,]    1    4
# [2,]    2    5
# [3,]    3    6
# Unlike a vector, the class of a matrix is "matrix", no matter what's in it
class(mat) # => "matrix"
# Ask for the first row
mat[1,]	# 1 4
# Perform operation on the first column
3 * mat[,1]	# 3 6 9
# Ask for a specific cell
mat[3,2]	# 6
# Transpose the whole matrix
t(mat)
# =>
#      [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]    1    2    3
# [2,]    4    5    6

# cbind() sticks vectors together column-wise to make a matrix
mat2 <- cbind(1:4, c("dog", "cat", "bird", "dog"))
mat2
# =>
#      [,1] [,2]   
# [1,] "1"  "dog"  
# [2,] "2"  "cat"  
# [3,] "3"  "bird" 
# [4,] "4"  "dog"
class(mat2)	# matrix
# Again, note what happened!
# Because matrices must contain entries all of the same class,
# everything got converted to the character class
c(class(mat2[,1]), class(mat2[,2]))

# rbind() sticks vectors together row-wise to make a matrix
mat3 <- rbind(c(1,2,4,5), c(6,7,0,4))
mat3
# =>
#      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
# [1,]    1    2    4    5
# [2,]    6    7    0    4
# Aah, everything of the same class. No coercions. Much better.

# TWO-DIMENSIONAL (DIFFERENT CLASSES)

# For columns of different classes, use the data frame
dat <- data.frame(c(5,2,1,4), c("dog", "cat", "bird", "dog"))
names(dat) <- c("number", "species") # name the columns
class(dat)	# "data.frame"
dat
# =>
#   number species
# 1      5     dog
# 2      2     cat
# 3      1    bird
# 4      4     dog
class(dat$number)	# "numeric"
class(dat[,2])	# "factor"
# The data.frame() function converts character vectors to factor vectors

# There are many twisty ways to subset data frames, all subtly unalike
dat$number	# 5 2 1 4
dat[,1]	# 5 2 1 4
dat[,"number"]	# 5 2 1 4

# MULTI-DIMENSIONAL (ALL OF ONE CLASS)

# Arrays creates n-dimensional tables
# You can make a two-dimensional table (sort of like a matrix)
array(c(c(1,2,4,5),c(8,9,3,6)), dim=c(2,4))
# =>
#      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
# [1,]    1    4    8    3
# [2,]    2    5    9    6
# You can use array to make three-dimensional matrices too
array(c(c(c(2,300,4),c(8,9,0)),c(c(5,60,0),c(66,7,847))), dim=c(3,2,2))
# =>
# , , 1
#
#      [,1] [,2]
# [1,]    2    8
# [2,]  300    9
# [3,]    4    0
#
# , , 2
#
#      [,1] [,2]
# [1,]    5   66
# [2,]   60    7
# [3,]    0  847

# LISTS (MULTI-DIMENSIONAL, POSSIBLY RAGGED, OF DIFFERENT TYPES)

# Finally, R has lists (of vectors)
list1 <- list(time = 1:40)
list1$price = c(rnorm(40,.5*list1$time,4)) # random
list1

# You can get items in the list like so
list1$time
# You can subset list items like vectors
list1$price[4]

* Get R and the R GUI from [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) is another GUI
