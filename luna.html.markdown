[Luna](http://www.luna-lang.org/) appeals to me so much becuase of it is distinctive aprroach in dataflow works.

I started with its version of 1.0 beta and not stable enough.

I initialized a Chinese community [LunaCN](https://github.com/LunaCN) and [translate](https://github.com/LunaCN/luna-book-zh-cn) its [documents](https://github.com/luna/luna-book) at first time. Luna's documents is poor and not systematic, so i wanna write the summary for indroduction.

This was for [luna-lang.cn](http://luna-lang.cn/) originally. Enjoy with Lua!
