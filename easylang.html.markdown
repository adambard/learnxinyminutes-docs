**Easylang** is a simple programming language with built-in graphical functions and an easy-to-use and offline usable browser IDE. Its simple syntax and semantics make it well suited as a teaching and learning programming language. You can also use it to write graphical applications that you can embed in a web page. 

*Easylang* is statically typed and has as data types only strings and numbers (floating point), resizeable arrays of strings and numbers and arrays of arrays.

[The browser IDE](https://easylang.online/ide/) includes various tutorials, including one for beginners.

```
print "Hello world"
#
# number variable (64 bit floating point)
#
h = 3.14
print h
#
# string variable
#
str$ = "monkey"
# strings can grow
str$ &= " circus" 
print str$
#
# blocks end with 'end' or a dot, a newline has no
# other meaning than a space
#
for i = 1 to 5
  sum += i * i
.
print sum
#
# functions have value and reference
# parameters, no return values
#
func gcd a b . res .
  # a and b are value parameters
  # res is a reference parameter
  while b <> 0
    # h is a local variable, because 
    # it is first used in the function
    h = b
    b = a mod b
    a = h
  .
  res = a
.
call gcd 120 35 r
print r
#
# strings can be concatenated and numbers are
# automatically converted to strings
#
print "1 + 2 = " & 1 + 2
#
# array of numbers
#
a[] = [ 2.1 3.14 3 ]
#
# arrays can grow
a[] &= 4

#
# arrays, strings and numbers are copied by value
#

#
# array swapping ist fast
#

# array of strings
#

# strings are also used for single characters
#

# 2-dimensional arrays are arrays of arrays

#

Built-in graphic primitives and event-driven programming

```
# simple drawing with the mouse
# 
set_linewidth 4
set_color 900
# the colors are coded from 0 to 999, with 
# the left digit specifying the red component,
# the middle digit the green component and
# the right digit the blue component. 
# 
on mouse_down
  down = 1
  move_pen mouse_x mouse_y
  # moves the drawing pen to the actual mouse position
  draw_circle 2
.
on mouse_up
  down = 0
.
on mouse_move
  if down = 1
    draw_line mouse_x mouse_y
  .
.
```

```
# an animated pendulum

  # The animate event occurs after each screen refresh.
