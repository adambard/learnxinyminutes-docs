**Dart** is a single threaded, general purpose programming language.
It borrows a lot from other mainstream languages.
It supports Streams, Futures(known as Promises in JavaScript), Generics, First-class functions(closures) and static type checking.
Dart can run in any platform such as Web, CLI, Desktop, Mobile and IoT devices.

Dart's most controversial feature is its ~~Optional Typing~~ Static Type safety and [Sound Type checks](https://dart.dev/guides/language/sound-dart).

/// Code doc comment
/// It uses markdown syntax to generate code docs when making an API.
/// Code doc comment is the recommended choice when documenting your APIs, classes and methods.

/// 4 types of variable declaration.
/// Constants are variables that are immutable cannot be change or altered.
/// `const` in dart should practice SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE name declaration.

/// Final is another variable declaration that cannot be change once it has been instantiated. Commonly used in classes and functions
/// `final` can be declared in pascalCase.

/// `var` is another variable declaration that is mutable and can change its value. Dart will infer types and will not change its data type
