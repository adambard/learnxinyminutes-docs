Go was created out of the need to get work done. It's not the latest trend
in computer science, but it is the newest fastest way to solve real-world
problems.

It has familiar concepts of imperative languages with static typing.
It's fast to compile and fast to execute, it adds easy-to-understand
concurrency to leverage today's multi-core CPUs, and has features to
help with large-scale programming.

Go comes with a great standard library and an enthusiastic community.

// Main is a special name declaring an executable rather than a library.

	"net/http"  // Yes, a web server!
	"os"        // OS functions like working with the file system
	"strconv"   // String conversions.
)

// A function definition. Main is special. It is the entry point for the

// If there are no parameters, empty parentheses are still required.

	// trailing ellipsis, meaning take a slice and unpack its elements,
	// appending them to slice s.

## Further Reading

The root of all things Go is the [official Go web site](http://golang.org/).
There you can follow the tutorial, play interactively, and read lots.
Aside from a tour, [the docs](https://golang.org/doc/) contain information on
how to write clean and effective Go code, package and command docs, and release history.

The language definition itself is highly recommended. It's easy to read
and amazingly short (as language definitions go these days.)

You can play around with the code on [Go playground](https://play.golang.org/p/tnWMjr16Mm). Try to change it and run it from your browser! Note that you can use [https://play.golang.org](https://play.golang.org) as a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop) to test things and code in your browser, without even installing Go.

On the reading list for students of Go is the [source code to the standard
library](http://golang.org/src/pkg/). Comprehensively documented, it
demonstrates the best of readable and understandable Go, Go style, and Go
idioms. Or you can click on a function name in [the
documentation](http://golang.org/pkg/) and the source code comes up!

Another great resource to learn Go is [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/).

Go Mobile adds support for mobile platforms (Android and iOS). You can write all-Go native mobile apps or write a library that contains bindings from a Go package, which can be invoked via Java (Android) and Objective-C (iOS). Check out the [Go Mobile page](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile) for more information.
