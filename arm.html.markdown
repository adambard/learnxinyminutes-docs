<!-- Info about ARM and ARM assembly. -->
ARM (Acorn RISC Machine) is an architecture based on the Reduced Instruction Set (RISC) paradigm. Being based on RISC, it has lesser hardware complexity compared to CISC based contemporaries. However, this leaves the burden of complexity on compilers and assemblers.

With over 100 billion ARM processors produced as of 2017, ARM is the most widely used instruction set architecture and the instruction set architecture produced in the largest quantity
