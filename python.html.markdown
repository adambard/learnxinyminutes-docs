Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in the early 90's. It is now one of the most popular
languages in existence. I fell in love with Python for it's syntactic clarity. It's basically
executable pseudocode.

Feedback would be highly appreciated! You can reach me at [@louiedinh](http://twitter.com/louiedinh) or louiedinh [at] [google's email service]

Note: This article applies to Python 2.7 specifically, but should be applicable
to Python 2.x. Look for another tour of Python 3 soon!

```python
# Single line comments start with a hash.
""" Multiline strings can we written
    using three "'s, and are often used
    as comments

## 1. Primitive Datatypes and Operators
####################################################

# You have numbers
3 #=> 3

# Math is what you would expect
1 + 1 #=> 2
8 - 1 #=> 7
10 * 2 #=> 20
35 / 5 #=> 7

# Division is a bit tricky. It is integer division and floors the results
# automatically.
5 / 2 #=> 2

# To fix division we need to learn about floats.
2.0     # This is a float
11.0 / 4.0 #=> 2.75 ahhh...much better

# Enforce precedence with parentheses
(1 + 3) * 2 #=> 8

# Boolean values are primitives
True
False

# negate with not
not True #=> False
not False #=> True

# Equality is ==
1 == 1 #=> True
2 == 1 #=> False

# Inequality is !=
1 != 1 #=> False
2 != 1 #=> True

# More comparisons
1 < 10 #=> True
1 > 10 #=> False
2 <= 2 #=> True
2 >= 2 #=> True

# Comparisons can be chained  !
1 < 2 < 3 #=> True
2 < 3 < 2 #=> False

# Strings are created with " or '
"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'

# Strings can be added too!
"Hello " + "world!" #=> "Hello world!"

# A string can be treated like a list of characters
"This is a string"[0] #=> 'T'

# % can be used to format strings, like this:
"%s can be %s" % ("strings", "interpolated")

# A newer way to format strings is the format method.
# This method is the preferred way
"{0} can be {1}".format("strings", "formatted")

# None is an object
None #=> None

## 2. Variables and Collections
####################################################

# Printing is pretty easy
print "I'm Python. Nice to meet you!"


# No need to declare variables before assigning to them.
some_var = 5    # Convention is to use lower_case_with_underscores
some_var #=> 5

# Accessing a previously unassigned variable is an exception
try:
    some_other_var
except NameError:
    print "Raises a name error"

# if can be used as an expression
some_var = a if a > b else b
# If a is greater than b, then a is assigned to some_var.
# Otherwise b is assigned to some_var.

# Lists store sequences
li = []
# You can start with a prefilled list
other_li = [4, 5, 6]

# Add stuff to the end of a list with append
li.append(1)    #li is now [1]
li.append(2)    #li is now [1, 2]
li.append(4)    #li is now [1, 2, 4]
li.append(3)    #li is now [1, 2, 4, 3]
# Remove from the end with pop
li.pop()        #=> 3 and li is now [1, 2, 4]
# Let's put it back
li.append(3)    # li is now [1, 2, 4, 3] again.

# Access a list like you would any array
li[0] #=> 1
# Look at the last element
li[-1] #=> 3

# Looking out of bounds is an IndexError
try:
    li[4] # Raises an IndexError
except IndexError:
    print "Raises an IndexError"

# You can look at ranges with slice syntax.
# (It's a closed/open range for you mathy types.)
li[1:3] #=> [2, 4]
# Omit the beginning
li[2:] #=> [4, 3]
# Omit the end
li[:3] #=> [1, 2, 4]

# Remove arbitrary elements from a list with del
del li[2] # li is now [1, 2, 3]

# You can add lists
li + other_li #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] - Note: li and other_li is left alone

# Concatenate lists with extend
li.extend(other_li) # Now li is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Check for existence in a list with in
1 in li #=> True

# Examine the length with len
len(li) #=> 6

# Tuples are like lists but are immutable.
tup = (1, 2, 3)
tup[0] #=> 1
try:
    tup[0] = 3  # Raises a TypeError
except TypeError:
    print "Tuples cannot be mutated."

# You can do all those list thingies on tuples too
len(tup) #=> 3
tup + (4, 5, 6) #=> (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
tup[:2] #=> (1, 2)
2 in tup #=> True

# You can unpack tuples into variables
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)     # a is now 1, b is now 2 and c is now 3
# Tuples are created by default if you leave out the parentheses
d, e, f = 4, 5, 6
# Now look how easy it is to swap two values
e, d = d, e     # d is now 5 and e is now 4


# Dictionaries store mappings
empty_dict = {}
# Here is a prefilled dictionary
filled_dict = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}

# Look up values with []
filled_dict["one"] #=> 1

# Get all keys as a list
filled_dict.keys() #=> ["three", "two", "one"]
# Note - Dictionary key ordering is not guaranteed.
# Your results might not match this exactly.

# Get all values as a list
filled_dict.values() #=> [3, 2, 1]
# Note - Same as above regarding key ordering.

# Check for existence of keys in a dictionary with in
"one" in filled_dict #=> True
1 in filled_dict #=> False

# Trying to look up a non-existing key will raise a KeyError
filled_dict["four"] #=> KeyError

# Use get method to avoid the KeyError
filled_dict.get("one") #=> 1
filled_dict.get("four") #=> None

# The get method supports a default argument when the value is missing
filled_dict.get("one", 4) #=> 1
filled_dict.get("four", 4) #=> 4

# Setdefault method is a safe way to add new key-value pair into dictionary
filled_dict.setdefault("five", 5) #filled_dict["five"] is set to 5
filled_dict.setdefault("five", 6) #filled_dict["five"] is still 5


# Sets store ... well sets
empty_set = set()
# Initialize a set with a bunch of values
some_set = set([1,2,2,3,4]) # filled_set is now set([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Since Python 2.7, {} can be used to declare a set
filled_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4} # => {1 2 3 4}

# Add more items to a set
filled_set.add(5) # filled_set is now {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Do set intersection with &
other_set = set{3, 4, 5, 6}
filled_set & other_set #=> {3, 4, 5}

# Do set union with |
filled_set | other_set #=> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Do set difference with -
{1,2,3,4} - {2,3,5} #=> {1, 4}

# Check for existence in a set with in
2 in filled_set #=> True
10 in filled_set #=> False
