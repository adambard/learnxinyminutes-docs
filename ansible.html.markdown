```yml
---
"{{ Ansible }}" is an orchestration tool written in Python.

```

## Example
An example playbook to install apache and configure log level
```yml
---
- hosts: apache

  vars:
      apache2_log_level: "warn"

  handlers:
  - name: restart apache
    service: 
      name: apache2
      state: restarted
      enabled: True
    notify: 
      - Wait for instances to listen on port 80
    become: True

  - name: reload apache
    service: 
      name: apache2
      state: reloaded
    notify: 
      - Wait for instances to listen on port 80
    become: True

  - name: Wait for instances to listen on port 80
    wait_for: 
      state: started 
      host: localhost 
      port: 80 
      timeout: 15 
      delay: 5

  tasks:
  - name: Update cache 
    apt: 
      update_cache: yes 
      cache_valid_time: 7200
    become: True

  - name: Install packages
    apt: 
      name={{ item }}
    with_items:
      - apache2
      - logrotate
    notify:
      - restart apache
    become: True

  - name: Configure apache2 log level
    lineinfile: 
      dest: /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
      line: "LogLevel {{ apache2_log_level }}"
      regexp: "^LogLevel"
    notify:
      - reload apache
    become: True

```

## Installation
```bash
# Universal way
$ pip install ansible

# Debian, Ubuntu
$ apt-get install ansible

```
* [Appendix A - How do I install ansible](#infrastructure-as-a-code)
* [Additional Reading.](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html)

### Your first ansible command (shell execution)
```bash
# This command ping the localhost (defined in default inventory: /etc/ansible/hosts) 
$ ansible -m ping localhost
# you should see this output
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}

```
### Shell Commands
There are few commands you should know about

* `ansible` (to run modules in CLI)
* `ansible-playbook` (to run playbooks)
* `ansible-vault` (to manage secrets)
* `ansible-galaxy` (to install roles from github/galaxy)
* and other!

### Module
_program (usally python) that execute, do some work and return proper JSON output_

This *program* perform specialized task/action (like manage instances in the cloud, execute shell command).

The simplest module is called `ping` - it just returns a JSON with `pong` message.

Example of modules:
* Module: `ping` - the simplest module that is usefull to verify host connectivity
* Module: `shell` - a module that executes shell command on a specified host(s).

Example of execution - `ping`, `shell`

```bash
$ ansible -m ping all
$ ansible -m shell -a 'date; whoami' localhost #hostname_or_a_group_name
```

* Module: `command` - executes a single command that will not be processed through the shell, so variables like $HOME or operands like `|` `;` will not work. The command module is more secure, because it will not be affected by the user’s environment. For more complex command - use shell module.


```bash
$ ansible -m command -a 'date; whoami' # FAILURE

$ ansible -m command -a 'date' all
$ ansible -m command -a 'whoami' all
```

* Module: `file` - performs file operations (stat, link, dir, ...) 
* Module: `raw` - executes a low-down and dirty SSH command, not going through the module subsystem (usefull to install python2.7)

### Task
  Execution of a single Ansible **module** is called a **task**

   The simplest module is called `ping` as you could see above

   Another example of the module that allow you to execute command remotly on multiple resources is called `shell`. See above how you were using them already.


### Playbook
**Execution plan** written in a form of script file(s) is called **playbook**.
Playbook consist of multiple elements
* a list (or group) of hosts that 'the play' is executed against
* `task(s)` or `role(s)` that are going to be executed
* multiple optional settings (like default variables, and way more)

Playbook script language is YAML.

You can think that playbook is very advanced CLI script that you are executing.


#### Example of the playbook:
This example-playbook would execute (on all hosts defined in the inventory) two tasks:
* `ping` that would return message *pong*
* `shell` that execute three commands and return the output to our terminal

```yml
- hosts: all
  
  tasks:
    - name: "ping all"
      ping:
  
    - name: "execute a shell command"
      shell: "date; whoami; df -h;"
```

Run the playbook with the command:
```bash
$ ansible-playbook path/name_of_the_playbook.yml
```
_Note: Example playbook is explained in the next chapter: 'Roles'
### More on ansible concept

### Inventory
Inventory is a set of an objects or hosts, against which we are executing our playbooks or single tasks via shell commands
For this few minutes, lets asume that we are using default ansible inventory (which in Debian based system is placed in /etc/ansible/hosts)

`/etc/ansible/hosts`
```
localhost

[some_group]
hostA.mydomain.com
hostB.localdomain
1.2.3.4

[a_group_of_a_groups:children]
some_group
some_other_group

```
* [Additional Reading.](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html)
### ansible-roles (a 'template-playbooks' with right structure)

   You already know that the tasks (modules) can be run via CLI. You also know the playbooks - the execution plans of multiple tasks (with variables and logic).

A concept called `role` was introduced for parts of the code (playbooks) that should be reusable.

**Role** is a structured way to manage your set of tasks, variables, handlers, default settings, and way more (meta, files, templates).
Role allows to reuse the same parts of code in multiple plybooks (you can parametrize the role 'further' during it's execution).
It is a great way to introduce `object oriented` management for your applications.

Role can be included in your playbook (executed via your playbook).


```yml
- hosts: all

  tasks:
      - name: "ping all"
        ping:
      - name: "execute a shell command"
        shell: "date; whoami; df -h;"
  
  roles: 
      - some_role
      - { role: another_role, some_variable: 'learnxiny', tags: ['my_tag'] }
  
  pre_tasks:
      - name: some pre-task
        shell: echo 'this task is the last, but would be executed before roles, and before tasks'
```

#### For remaining examples we would use additional repository
This example install ansible in `virtualenv` so it is independend from a system. You need to initialize it into your shell-context with `source environment.sh` command. 

We are going to use repository with examples: https://github.com/sirkubax/ansible-for-learnXinYminutes

```bash
$ # The folowing example contains a shell-prompt to indicate the venv and relative path 
$ git clone git@github.com:sirkubax/ansible-for-learnXinYminutes.git
user@host:~/$ cd ansible-for-learnXinYminutes
user@host:~/ansible-for-learnXinYminutes$ source environment.sh
$
$ # First lets execute the simple_playbook.yml
(venv) user@host:~/ansible-for-learnXinYminutes$ ansible-playbook playbooks/simple_playbook.yml

```

Run the playbook with roles example
```bash
$ source environment.sh
$ # Now we would run the above playbook with roles
(venv) user@host:~/ansible-for-learnXinYminutes$ ansible-playbook playbooks/simple_role.yml
```

#### Role directory structure:
```
roles/
   some_role/
     defaults/      # contains default variables
     files/         # for static files
     templates/     # for jinja templates
     tasks/         # tasks
     handlers/      # handlers
     vars/          # more variables (higher priority)
     meta/          # meta - package (role) info
```

#### Role Handlers
Handlers are a tasks that can be triggered (notified) during execution of a playbook, but they itself execute at the very end of a playbook.
It is a best way to restart a service, check if application port is active (successfull deployment criteria), etc.

Please get familiar how you can use role in simple_apache_role example
```
playbooks/roles/simple_apache_role/
├── tasks
│   └── main.yml
└── templates
    └── main.yml
```

### ansible - variables

Ansible is flexible - it has 21 levels of variable precedence

[read more](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable)

For now you should know that CLI variables have the top priority.

You should also know, that a nice way to pool some data is a **lookup**

### Lookups
Awesome tool to query data from various sources!!! Awesome!  
query from:

* pipe  (load shell command output into variable!)
* file
* stream
* etcd
* password management tools
* url

```bash
# read playbooks/lookup.yml
# then run
(venv) user@host:~/ansible-for-learnXinYminutes$ ansible-playbook playbooks/lookup.yml
```

You can use them in CLI too
```yaml
ansible -m shell -a 'echo "{{ my_variable }}"' -e 'my_variable="{{ lookup("pipe", "date") }}"' localhost
ansible -m shell -a 'echo "{{ my_variable }}"' -e 'my_variable="{{ lookup("pipe", "hostname") }}"' all

# Or use in playbook

(venv) user@host:~/ansible-for-learnXinYminutes$ ansible-playbook playbooks/lookup.yml

```

### Register and Conditional 

#### Register
Another way to dynamicaly generate the variable content is a `register` command.
`Register` is also useful to store an output of a task, and use it's value as a logic 
for execution further tasks.
```
(venv) user@host:~/ansible-for-learnXinYminutes$ ansible-playbook playbooks/register_and_when.yml
```

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
   - name: check the system capacity
     shell: df -h /
     register: root_size

   - name: debug root_size
     debug:
        msg: "{{ root_size }}"
   
   - name: debug root_size return code
     debug:
       msg:  "{{ root_size.rc }}"

# when: example           

   - name: Print this message when return code of 'check the system capacity' was ok
     debug:
       msg:  "{{ root_size.rc }}"
     when: root_size.rc == 0

```
#### Conditionals - when:

You can define complex logic with Ansible and Jinja functions. Most common is usage of `when:`, with some variable (often dynamicly generated in previous playbook steps with `register` or `lookup`)

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
   - name: check the system capacity
     shell: df -h /
     when: some_variable in 'a string'
  roles:
   - { role: mid_nagios_probe, when: allow_nagios_probes }
```


### ansible - tags, limit

You should know about a way to increase efficiency by this simple functionality

#### TAGS
You can tag a task, role (and its tasks), include, etc, and then run only the tagged resources

    ansible-playbook playbooks/simple_playbook.yml --tags=tagA,tag_other
    ansible-playbook playbooks/simple_playbook.yml -t tagA,tag_other

    There are special tags: 
        always
    
    --skip-tags can be used to exclude a block of code
    --list-tags to list available tags

[Read more](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_tags.html)

#### LIMIT
You can limit an execution of your tasks to defined hosts 

    ansible-playbook playbooks/simple_playbook.yml --limmit localhost

    --limit my_hostname
    --limit groupname
    --limit some_prefix*
    --limit hostname:group #JM

### Templates

Template is a powerfull way to deliver some (partially) dynamic content. Ansible uses **Jinja2** langueage to describe the template.

```jinja2
Some static content

{{ a_variable }}

{% for item in loop_items %} 
    this line item is {{ item }}
{% endfor %}
```
Jinja may have some limitations, but it is a powerfull tool that you might like.

Please examine this simple example that install apache2 and generate index.html from the template
"playbooks/roles/simple_apache_role/templates/index.html"

```bash
$ source environment.sh
$ # Now we would run the above playbook with roles
(venv) user@host:~/ansible-for-learnXinYminutes$ ansible-playbook playbooks/simple_role.yml --tags apache2
```


#### Jinja2 CLI
You can use the jinja in the CLI too
```bash
ansible -m shell -a 'echo {{ my_variable }}` -e 'my_variable=something, playbook_parameter=twentytwo" localhost
```
In fact - jinja is used to template parts of the playbooks too
```yml
#check part of this playbook: playbooks/roles/sys_debug/tasks/debug_time.yml
- local_action: shell date +'%F %T'
  register: ts
  become: False
  changed_when: False

- name: Timestamp
  debug: msg="{{ ts.stdout }}"
  when: ts is defined and ts.stdout is defined
  become: False

```

#### Jinja2 filters
Junja is powerfull. It has built-in many usefull functions.
```jinja
# get first item of the list
{{ some_list | first() }}
# if variable is undefined - use default value
{{ some_variable | default('default_value') }}
```
[Read More](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_filters.html)

### ansible-vault
To maintain **ifrastructure as a code** you need to store secrets. 
  Ansible provides a way to encrypt the confidential files so you can store it in the repository, yet the files are decrypted in-fly during ansible execution.

The best way to use the **ansible-vault** is to store the secret in some secure location, and configure ansible to use during runtime.

```bash
# Try (this would fail)
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/vault_example.yml

$ echo some_very_very_long_secret > ~/.ssh/secure_located_file

# in ansible.cfg set the path to your secret file
$ vi ansible.cfg
  ansible_vault_password_file = ~/.ssh/secure_located_file

#or use env
$ export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/.ssh/secure_located_file

$ ansible-playbook playbooks/vault_example.yml

  # encrypt the file
$ ansible-vault encrypt path/somefile

  # view the file
$ ansible-vault view path/somefile

  # check the file content:
$ cat path/somefile

  # decrypt the file
$ ansible-vault decrypt path/somefile
```

### dynamic inventory
You might like to know, that you can build your inventory dynamically.

(For Ansible) inventory is just a JSON with proper structure - if you can deliver that to ansible - anything is possible.

You do not need to invent the wheel - there are plenty ready to use inventory script for most popular Cloud provicers and a lot of in-house popular usecaseses.

[AWS example](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#example-aws-ec2-external-inventory-script)

```bash
$ etc/inv/ec2.py --refresh 

$ ansible -m ping all -i etc/inv/ec2.py
```

[Read more](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_dynamic_inventory.html)

### ansible profiling - callback
Playbook execution takes some time. It is OK. First make it run, then you may like to speed things up 

Since ansible 2.x there is built-in callback for task execution profiling

```
vi ansible.cfg 
#set this to:
callback_whitelist = profile_tasks
```

### facts-cache and ansible-cmdb
You can pool some infrmations of you environment from another hosts.
If the informations does not change - you may consider using a facts_cache to speed things up.

```
vi ansible.cfg

# if set to a persistent type (not 'memory', for example 'redis') fact values
# from previous runs in Ansible will be stored.  This may be useful when
# wanting to use, for example, IP information from one group of servers
# without having to talk to them in the same playbook run to get their
# current IP information.
fact_caching = jsonfile
fact_caching_connection = ~/facts_cache
fact_caching_timeout = 86400
```

I like to use `jsonfile` as my backend. It allows to use another project
`ansible-cmdb` [(project on github)](https://github.com/fboender/ansible-cmdb) that generates a HTML page of your inventory resources. A nice 'free' addition!

### debugging ansible [chapter in progres]
When your job fails - it is good to be effective with debugging.

1. Increase verbosiy by using multiple -v  **[ -vvvvv]**
2. If variable is undefined 
    - grep -R path_of_your_inventory -e missing_variable
3. If variable (dictionary or a list) is undefined
    - grep -R path_of_your_inventory -e missing_variable
4. Jinja template debug 
5. Strange behaviour - try to run the code 'at the destination'

### Infrastructure as a code
You already know, that ansible-vault allow you to store your confidential data along with your code (in repository). You can go further - and define your ansible installation and configuration as-a-code. 
See `environment.sh` to learn how to install the ansible itself inside a `virtualenv` that is not attached to your operating system (can be changed by non-privilages user), and as additional benefit - upgrading version of ansible is as easy as installing new version in new virtualenv. What is more, you can have multiple versions of Ansible present in the same time. This is very helpfull!

```bash
  # recreate ansible 2.x venv
$ rm -rf venv2
$ source environment2.sh
  # execute playbook
(venv2)$ ansible-playbook playbooks/ansible1.9_playbook.yml # would fail - deprecated syntax

  # now lets install ansible 1.9.x next to ansible 2.x
(venv2)$ deactivate
$ source environment.1.9.sh
  # execute playbook
(venv1.9)$ ansible-playbook playbooks/ansible1.9_playbook.yml # works!

  # please note that you have both venv1.9 and venv2 present - you need to (de)activate one - that is all
```

#### become-user, become
In Ansible - to become `sudo` - use the `become` parameter. Use `become_user` to specify the username.
```
- name: Ensure the httpd service is running
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: started
  become: true
```
Note: You may like to execute Ansible with `--ask-sudo-pass` or add the user to sudoers file in order to allow non-supervised execution if you require 'admin' privilages.

[Read more](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/become.html)

## Tips and tricks

#### --check -C
Always make sure that your playbook can executes in 'dry run' mode (--check), and it's execution is not declaring 'Changed' objects.

#### --diff -D
Diff is usefull to see nice detail of the files changed

It compare 'in memory' the files like `diff -BbruN fileA fileB`


#### Execute hosts with 'regex'
```bash
ansible -m ping web*
```

####
Host groups can be joined, negated, etc

```bash
ansible -m ping web*:!backend:monitoring:&allow_change
```

#### Tagging
You should tag some (not all) objects - a task in a playbook, all tasks included form a role, etc.
It allows you to execute the choosen parts of the playbook.

#### no_logs: True
You may see, that some roles print a lot of output in verbose mode. There is also a debug module.
This is the place where credentials may leak. Use `no_log` to hide the output.

#### Debug module
allows to print a value to the screen - use it!

#### Register the output of a task
You can register the output (stdout), rc (return code), stderr of a task with the `register` command.

#### Conditionals: when: 

#### Loop: with, with_items, with_dict, with_together

[Read more](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_conditionals.html)


## Introduction
Ansible is (one of the many) orchestration tools. It allows you to controll your environment (infrastructure and a code) and automate the manual tasks.
'You can think as simple as writing in bash with python API 
Of course the rabit hole is way deeper.'

Ansible have great integration with multiple operating systems (even Windows) and some hardware (switches, Firewalls, etc). It has multiple tools that integrate with the could providers. Almost every worth-notice cloud provider is present in the ecosystem (AWS, Azure, Google, DigitalOcean, OVH, etc...)


But ansible is way more! It provides an execution plans, an API, library, callbacks, not forget to mention - COMMUNITY! and great support by developers!


### Main cons and pros

#### Cons

It is an agent-less tool - every agent consumes up to 16MB ram - in some environments, it may be noticable amount.  
It is agent-less - you have to verify your environment consistency 'on-demand' - there is no built-in mechanism that would warn you about some change automatically (this can be achieved with reasonable effort)
Official GUI Tool (web inferface) - Ansible Tower - is great, but it is expensive. There is no 'small enterprice' payment plan. Easy workaround with Rundeck or Jenkins is possible with reasonable workload.  

#### Pros

It is an agent-less tools In most scenarios, it use ssh as a transport layer.   
In some way you can use it as 'bash on steroids'.  
It is very-very-very easy to start. If you are familiar with ssh concept - you already know Ansible (ALMOST). My personal record is: 'I did show "how to install and use ansible" (for simple raspberry pi cluster management) - it took me 30 seconds to deliver a complete working example !!!)'  
I do provide a training services - I'm able to teach a production-ready person - in 8 hours (1 training day)! It covers all needed to work aspects! No other tool can match this ease of use!  
It executes 'as is' - other tools (salt, puppet, chef - might execute in different scenario than you would expect)  
Documentation is at the world-class standard!  
The comunity (github, stackOverflow) would help you very fast.  
Writing own modules and extension is fairly easy.  

#### Neutral
Migration Ansible<->Salt is failrly easy - so if you would need an event-driven agent environment - it would be a good choice to start quick with Ansible, and convert to salt when needed.

#### Some concepts

Ansible uses ssh or paramiko as a transport layer. In a way you can imagine that you are using a ssh with API to perform your action.  
The simplest way is to execute remote command in more controlled way (still using ssh).   
On the other hand - in advanced scope - you can wrap Ansible (use python Ansible code as a library) with your own Python scrips! This is awesome! It would act a bit like Fabric then.
