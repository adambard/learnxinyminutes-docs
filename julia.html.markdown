Julia is a new homoiconic functional language focused on technical computing.
While having the full power of homoiconic macros, first-class functions,
and low-level control, Julia is as easy to learn and use as Python.

This is based on Julia version 1.0.0.

```julia
# Single line comments start with a hash (pound) symbol.
#= Multiline comments can be written
   by putting '#=' before the text  and '=#'
   after the text. They can also be nested.

####################################################
## 1. Primitive Datatypes and Operators
####################################################

# Everything in Julia is an expression.

# There are several basic types of numbers.
typeof(3)       # => Int64
typeof(3.2)     # => Float64
typeof(2 + 1im) # => Complex{Int64}
typeof(2 // 3)  # => Rational{Int64}

# All of the normal infix operators are available.
1 + 1      # => 2
8 - 1      # => 7
10 * 2     # => 20
35 / 5     # => 7.0
10 / 2     # => 5.0  # dividing integers always results in a Float64
div(5, 2)  # => 2    # for a truncated result, use div
5 \ 35     # => 7.0
2^2        # => 4    # power, not bitwise xor
12 % 10    # => 2

# Enforce precedence with parentheses
(1 + 3) * 2  # => 8

# Julia (unlike Python for instance) has integer under/overflow
10^19      # => -8446744073709551616
# use bigint or floating point to avoid this
big(10)^19 # => 10000000000000000000
1e19       # => 1.0e19
10.0^19    # => 1.0e19

# Bitwise Operators
~2         # => -3 # bitwise not
3 & 5      # => 1  # bitwise and
2 | 4      # => 6  # bitwise or
xor(2, 4)  # => 6  # bitwise xor
2 >>> 1    # => 1  # logical shift right
2 >> 1     # => 1  # arithmetic shift right
2 << 1     # => 4  # logical/arithmetic shift left

# Use the bitstring function to see the binary representation of a number.
bitstring(12345)
# => "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011000000111001"
bitstring(12345.0)
# => "0100000011001000000111001000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

# Boolean values are primitives
true
false

# Boolean operators
!true   # => false
!false  # => true
1 == 1  # => true
2 == 1  # => false
1 != 1  # => false
2 != 1  # => true
1 < 10  # => true
1 > 10  # => false
2 <= 2  # => true
2 >= 2  # => true
# Comparisons can be chained, like in Python but unlike many other languages
1 < 2 < 3  # => true
2 < 3 < 2  # => false

# Strings are created with "
"This is a string."

# Character literals are written with '
'a'

# Strings are UTF8 encoded, so strings like "π" or "☃" are not directly equivalent
# to an array of single characters.
# Only if they contain only ASCII characters can they be safely indexed.
ascii("This is a string")[1]    # => 'T'
# => 'T': ASCII/Unicode U+0054 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
# Beware, Julia indexes everything from 1 (like MATLAB), not 0 (like most languages).
# Otherwise, iterating over strings is recommended (map, for loops, etc).

# String can be compared lexicographically, in dictionnary order:
"good" > "bye"   # => true
"good" == "good" # => true
"1 + 2 = 3" == "1 + 2 = $(1 + 2)" # => true

# $(..) can be used for string interpolation:
"2 + 2 = $(2 + 2)" # => "2 + 2 = 4"
# You can put any Julia expression inside the parentheses.

# Printing is easy
println("I'm Julia. Nice to meet you!")  # => I'm Julia. Nice to meet you!

# Another way to format strings is the printf macro from the stdlib Printf.
using Printf   # this is how you load (or import) a module
@printf "%d is less than %f\n" 4.5 5.3   # => 5 is less than 5.300000


####################################################
## 2. Variables and Collections
####################################################

# You don't declare variables before assigning to them.
someVar = 5  # => 5
someVar      # => 5

# Accessing a previously unassigned variable is an error
try
    someOtherVar  # => ERROR: UndefVarError: someOtherVar not defined
catch e
    println(e)
end

# Variable names start with a letter or underscore.
# After that, you can use letters, digits, underscores, and exclamation points.
SomeOtherVar123! = 6  # => 6

# You can also use certain unicode characters
# here ☃ is a Unicode 'snowman' characters, see http://emojipedia.org/%E2%98%83%EF%B8%8F if it displays wrongly here
☃ = 8  # => 8
# These are especially handy for mathematical notation, like the constant π
2 * π  # => 6.283185307179586

# A note on naming conventions in Julia:
#
# * Word separation can be indicated by underscores ('_'), but use of
#   underscores is discouraged unless the name would be hard to read
#   otherwise.
#
# * Names of Types begin with a capital letter and word separation is shown
#   with CamelCase instead of underscores.
#
# * Names of functions and macros are in lower case, without underscores.
#
# * Functions that modify their inputs have names that end in !. These
#   functions are sometimes called mutating functions or in-place functions.

# Arrays store a sequence of values indexed by integers 1 through n:
a = Int64[] # => 0-element Array{Int64,1}

# 1-dimensional array literals can be written with comma-separated values.
b = [4, 5, 6] # => 3-element Array{Int64,1}: [4, 5, 6]
b = [4; 5; 6] # => 3-element Array{Int64,1}: [4, 5, 6]
b[1]    # => 4
b[end]  # => 6

# 2-dimensional arrays use space-separated values and semicolon-separated rows.
matrix = [1 2; 3 4] # => 2×2 Array{Int64,2}: [1 2; 3 4]

# Arrays of a particular type
b = Int8[4, 5, 6] # => 3-element Array{Int8,1}: [4, 5, 6]

# Add stuff to the end of a list with push! and append!
# By convention, the exclamation mark '!' is appended to names of functions
# that modify their arguments
push!(a, 1)    # => [1]
push!(a, 2)    # => [1,2]
push!(a, 4)    # => [1,2,4]
push!(a, 3)    # => [1,2,4,3]
append!(a, b)  # => [1,2,4,3,4,5,6]

pop!(b)  # => 6
b # => [4,5]

# Let's put it back
push!(b, 6)  # => [4,5,6]
b # => [4,5,6]

a[1]  # => 1  # remember that Julia indexes from 1, not 0!

# end is a shorthand for the last index. It can be used in any
# indexing expression
a[end]  # => 6

# we also have popfirst! and pushfirst!
popfirst!(a)  # => 1 
a # => [2,4,3,4,5,6]
pushfirst!(a, 7)  # => [7,2,4,3,4,5,6]
a # => [7,2,4,3,4,5,6]

# Function names that end in exclamations points indicate that they modify
# their argument.

####################################################
## 5. Types
####################################################

# Julia has a type system.
# Every value has a type; variables do not have types themselves.
# You can use the `typeof` function to get the type of a value.
typeof(5)  # => Int64

# Types are first-class values
typeof(Int64)     # => DataType
typeof(DataType)  # => DataType
# DataType is the type that represents types, including itself.

# Types are used for documentation, optimizations, and dispatch.
# They are not statically checked.

# Users can define types
# They are like records or structs in other languages.
# New types are defined using the `struct` keyword.

# struct Name
#   field::OptionalType
#   ...
# end
struct Tiger
    taillength::Float64
    coatcolor  # not including a type annotation is the same as `::Any`
end

# The default constructor's arguments are the properties
# of the type, in the order they are listed in the definition
tigger = Tiger(3.5, "orange")  # => Tiger(3.5,"orange")

# The type doubles as the constructor function for values of that type
sherekhan = typeof(tigger)(5.6, "fire")  # => Tiger(5.6,"fire")

# These struct-style types are called concrete types
# They can be instantiated, but cannot have subtypes.
# The other kind of types is abstract types.

# abstract Name
abstract type Cat end  # just a name and point in the type hierarchy

# Abstract types cannot be instantiated, but can have subtypes.
# For example, Number is an abstract type
subtypes(Number)  # => 2-element Array{Any,1}:
                  # =>  Complex
                  # =>  Real
subtypes(Cat)  # => 0-element Array{Any,1}

# AbstractString, as the name implies, is also an abstract type
subtypes(AbstractString)  # => 4-element Array{Any,1}:
                          # =>  String
                          # =>  SubString
                          # =>  SubstitutionString
                          # =>  Test.GenericString

# Every type has a super type; use the `supertype` function to get it.
typeof(5) # => Int64
supertype(Int64)    # => Signed
supertype(Signed)   # => Integer
supertype(Integer)  # => Real
supertype(Real)     # => Number
supertype(Number)   # => Any
supertype(supertype(Signed))  # => Real
supertype(Any)      # => Any
# All of these type, except for Int64, are abstract.
typeof("fire")      # => String
supertype(String)   # => AbstractString
# Likewise here with String
supertype(SubString)  # => AbstractString

# <: is the subtyping operator
struct Lion <: Cat  # Lion is a subtype of Cat
    maneColor
    roar::AbstractString
end

# You can define more constructors for your type
# Just define a function of the same name as the type
# and call an existing constructor to get a value of the correct type
Lion(roar::AbstractString) = Lion("green", roar)
# This is an outer constructor because it's outside the type definition

struct Panther <: Cat  # Panther is also a subtype of Cat
    eyeColor
    Panther() = new("green")
    # Panthers will only have this constructor, and no default constructor.
end
# Using inner constructors, like Panther does, gives you control
# over how values of the type can be created.
# When possible, you should use outer constructors rather than inner ones.

####################################################
## 6. Multiple-Dispatch
####################################################

# In Julia, all named functions are generic functions
# This means that they are built up from many small methods
# Each constructor for Lion is a method of the generic function Lion.

# For a non-constructor example, let's make a function meow:

# Definitions for Lion, Panther, Tiger
function meow(animal::Lion)
    animal.roar  # access type properties using dot notation
end

function meow(animal::Panther)
    "grrr"
end

function meow(animal::Tiger)
    "rawwwr"
end

# Testing the meow function
meow(tigger)  # => "rawwwr"
meow(Lion("brown", "ROAAR"))  # => "ROAAR"
meow(Panther()) # => "grrr"

# Review the local type hierarchy
Tiger   <: Cat  # => false
Lion    <: Cat  # => true
Panther <: Cat  # => true

# Defining a function that takes Cats
function pet_cat(cat::Cat)
    println("The cat says $(meow(cat))")
end
# => pet_cat (generic function with 1 method)
