# Binary Search

## Why Binary Search?

Searching is one of the prime problems in the domain of Computer Science.Today there are more than 1 trillion searches per year, and we need algorithms that can do that very fastly. Binary search is one of the fundamental algorithms in computer science. In order to explore it, we’ll first build up a theoretical backbone, then use that to implement the algorithm properly.

## Algorithm

The basic requirement for binary search to work is that the data to search should be sorted (in any order).
### Types of functions, limits, and simplification

```
Logarithmic Function - log n
Linear Function - an + b
Quadratic Function - an^2 + bn + c
Polynomial Function - an^z + . . . + an^2 + a*n^1 + a*n^0, where z is some constant
Exponential Function - a^n, where a is some constant
```
Since we want simplest form, lets modify our table a bit...

```
Logarithmic - log n
Linear - n
Quadratic - n^2
Polynomial - n^z, where z is some constant
Exponential - a^n, where a is some constant
```


*Example 2*

Is `f(n)` O(g(n))?
Is `3 * n^2` O(n)?
Let's look at the definition of Big-O.

```
3 * n^2 <= c * n
```



`f(n)` is Ω(g(n)), if for any real constant c (c > 0), `f(n)` is >= `c g(n)` for every input size n (n > 0).
