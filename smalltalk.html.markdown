- Smalltalk is a fully object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language with no 'non-object' types.
- Smalltalk was created as the language to underpin the "new world" of computing exemplified by "humanâ€“computer symbiosis."
- It was designed and created in part for educational use, more so for constructionist learning, at the Learning Research Group (LRG) of Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Scott Wallace, and others during the 1970s.

## The Basics

### Everything is an object
Yes, everything. Integers are instances of one of the numeric classes. Classes are instances of the class Metaclass and are just as manipulable as any other object. All classes are part of a single class tree; no disjoint class trees. Stack frames are objects and can be manipulated, which is how the debugger works. There are no pointers into memory locations that you can dereference and mess with.

### Functions are not called; messages are sent to objects
- Work is done by sending messages to objects, which decide how to respond to that message and run a method as a result, which eventually returns some object to the original message sending code.
- The system knows the class of the object receiving a message and looks up the message in that class's list of methods. If it is not found, the lookup continues in the super class until either it is found or the root of the classes is reached and there is still no relevant method. 
- If a suitable method is found the code is run, and the same process keeps on going with all the methods sent by that method and so on forever.
- If no suitable method is found an exception is raised, which typically results in a user interface notifier to tell the user that the message was not understood. It is entirely possible to catch the exception and do something to fix the problem, which might range from 'ignore it' to 'load some new packages for this class and try again'.
- A method (more strictly an instance of the class CompiledMethod) is a chunk of Smalltalk code that has been compiled into bytecodes. Executing methods start at the beginning and return to the sender when a return is encountered (we use ^ to signify 'return the follwing object') or the end of the code is reached, in which case the current object running the code is returned.

### Simple syntax
Smalltalk has a simple syntax with very few rules. 
The most basic operation is to send a message to an object
`anObject aMessage`

There are three sorts of messages

- unary - a single symbol that may be several words conjoined in what we call camelcase form, with no arguments. For example 'size', 'reverseBytes', 'convertToLargerFormatPixels'
- binary - a small set of symbols of the sort often used for arithmetic operations in most languages, requiring a single argument. For example '+', '//', '@'. We do not use traditional arithmetic precedence, something to keep an eye on.
- keyword - the general form where multiple arguments can be passed. As with the unary form we use camelcase to join words together but arguments are inserted in the midst of the message with colons used to separate them lexically. For example 'setTemperature:', 'at:put:', 'drawFrom:to:lineWidth:fillColor:'

#### An example
`result := myObject doSomethingWith: thatObject`
We are sending the message 'doSomethingWith:' to myObject. This happens to be a message that has a single argument but that's not important yet.
'myObject' is a 'MyExampleClass' instance so the system looks at the list of messages understood by MyExampleClass

- beClever
- doWierdThing:
- doSomethingWith

In searching we see what initially looks like a match - but no, it lacks the final colon. So we find the super class of MyExampleClass - BigExampleClass. Which has a list of known messages of its own

- beClever
- doSomethingWith:
- buildCastleInAir
- annoyUserByDoing:

We find a proper exact match and start to execute the code:

```smalltalk
doSomethingWith: argumentObject
    self size > 4 ifTrue: [^argumentObject sizeRelatingTo: self].
```   

Everything here except the `^` involves sending more messages. Event the `ifTrue:` that you might think is a language control structure is just Smalltalk code.

We start by sending `size` to `self`. `self` is the object currently running the code - so in this case it is the myObject we started with. `size` is a very common message that we might anticipate tells us something about how big an object is; you could look it up with the Smalltalk tools very simply. The result we get is then sent the message `>` with the plain old integer 4 (which is an object too; no strange primitive types to pollute the system here) and nobody should be surprised the `>` is a comparison that answers true or false. That boolean (which is actually a Boolean object in Smalltalk) is sent the message `ifTrue:` with the block of code between the `[]` as its argument; obvioulsy a true boolean might be expected to run that block of code and a false to ignore it. 

If the block is run then we do some more message sending to the argument object and noting the `^` we return the answer back to our starting point and it gets assigned to `result`. If the block is ignored we seem to run out of code and so `self` is returned and assigned to `result`.

#### Allowable characters:
- a-z
- A-Z
- 0-9
- .+/\*~<>@%|&?
- blank, tab, cr, ff, lf

#### Variables:
- variable names must be declared before use but are untyped
- shared vars (globals, class vars) conventionally begin with uppercase (except the reserved names shown below)
- local vars (instance vars, temporaries, method & block arguments) conventionally begin with lowercase
- reserved names: `nil`, `true`, `false`, `self`, `super`, and `thisContext`

#### Variable scope:
- Global: defined in a Dictionary named 'Smalltalk' and accessible by all objects in system
- Special: (reserved) `Smalltalk`, `super`, `self`, `true`, `false`, & `nil`
- Method Temporary: local to a method
- Block Temporary: local to a block
- Pool: variables in a Dictionary object, possibly shared with classes not directly related by inheritance
- Method Parameters: automatic method temp vars that name the incoming parameters. Cannot be assigned to 
- Block Parameters: automatic block temp vars that name the incoming parameters. Cannot be assigned to
- Class: shared with all instances of a class & its subclasses
- Class Instance: unique to each instance of a class. Too commonly confused with class variables
- Instance Variables: unique to each instance of a class

#### Bitwise Manipulation:
```smalltalk
| b x |
x := 16rFF bitAnd: 16r0F.           "and bits"
x := 16rF0 bitOr: 16r0F.            "or bits"

b := 16rFF noMask: 16r0F.           "test if all bits set in mask clear in receiver"
```

#### Conversion:
```smalltalk
| x |
x := 3.99 asInteger.               "convert number to integer (truncates in Squeak)"
x := 3.99 asFraction.              "convert number to fraction"

x := 15 printStringBase: 16.
x := 15 storeStringBase: 16.
```

#### Blocks:
- blocks are objects and may be assigned to a variable
- value is last expression evaluated unless explicit return
- blocks may be nested
- specification [ arguments | | localvars | expressions ]
- Squeak does not currently support localvars in blocks
- max of three arguments allowed
- `^`expression terminates block & method (exits all nested blocks)
- blocks intended for long term storage should not contain `^`

```smalltalk
| x y z |
x := [ y := 1. z := 2. ]. x value.                          "simple block usage"
x := [ :argOne :argTwo |   argOne, ' and ' , argTwo.].      "set up block with argument passing"
Transcript show: (x value: 'First' value: 'Second'); cr.    "use block with argument passing"

"x := [ | z | z := 1.]. *** localvars not available in squeak blocks"
```

#### Method calls:
- unary methods are messages with no arguments
- binary methods
- keyword methods are messages with selectors including colons standard categories/protocols:
- initialize-release    (methods called for new instance)
- accessing             (get/set methods)
- testing               (boolean tests - is)
- comparing             (boolean tests with parameter
- displaying            (gui related methods)
- printing              (methods for printing)
- updating              (receive notification of changes)
- private               (methods private to class)
- instance-creation     (class methods for creating instance)

```smalltalk
