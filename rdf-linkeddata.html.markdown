RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a [W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/) standard data definition language for structured data representation.

Data is expressed using sentences/statements that manifest as a subject->predicate->object or entity->attribute-value graph -- representable using a variety of notations and serialized using a variety of document content-types. [

[RDF-Turtle (Turtle)](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) is one an example of both a notation and content serialization type used for creating structured data using RDF. In regards to RDF-based structured data representation, Turtle provides the following benefits:

* Human readable notation syntax that aligns natural language subject->predicate->object sentence structure 
* Doubles as both a notation and document content-type

# Deployment using Linked Data Principles

Popularized by the World Wide Web, hyperlinks (typically HTTP URIs) provide powerful tooling for unambiguous entity naming. Net effect, you can contribute to a public or private "Web of Data" by simply denoting the subject, predicate, and object (optionally) of an RDF sentence using a hyperlink.

As per the example Turtle snippet provided below, you can extend this powerful structured data representation method by leveraging the dynamic power of relative HTTP URIs for entity naming. Net effect, your "Web of Data" is deployable from any HTTP-accessible document location.  

```turtle
## Turtle Start ##
@prefix : <#> . 

# The hash symbol is the comment delimiter. 

# Turtle triple statements end with periods like natural language sentences.

# These two triples tell us that the mythical Example Company's
# employee 134 has a hire date of 2022-11-12 and a family name of Smith:

:emp134 :hireDate "2022-11-12" .
:emp134 :familyName "Smith" .

# Declaring prefixes to stand in for namespaces reduces verbosity. These
# declarations typically go at the beginning of the file, but the only
# requirement is that they come before the first use of the prefix they declare.


:emp134 :hireDate "2022-11-12" .
:emp134 :familyName "Smith" .

# A semicolon means that the next triple uses the same subject as the last
# one. This is handy for listing data about a single resource. The following
# example means the same thing as the previous one.


:emp134 :hireDate "2022-11-12" ;
          :familyName "Smith" .

# A comma means that the next triple has the same subject and predicate as
# the previous one.

:emp134 :nickname "Smithy", "Skipper", "Big J". 

# Three single or double quote marks at the beginning and end of a value let
# you define a  multi-line string value.

:emp134 :description """
Skipper joined the company in November. 

He always has a joke for everyone.""" . 

# Using URIs from existing standard vocabulary namespaces eases both data
# integration and interoperability with the large amount of RDF that already
# exists. Mixing and matching of standard and local custom namespaces is
# common.

@prefix vcard: <http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#> .
:emp134 :hireDate "2022-11-12" ;
          vcard:family-name "Smith" .

# Related RDF standards provide vocabularies that are popular for basic
# facts. The rdfs:label predicate from the RDF Schema standard is a common 
# way to indicate a human-readable name.

@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
:hireDate rdfs:label "hire date" . 

# String object values can include language codes, making
# multi-lingual representation of entities easier for applications
# reading the data (for example, when generating a user interface).

:hireDate rdfs:label "hire date"@en, "date d'embauche"@fr  . 

# Representing a triple's object with a URI (or prefixed name) is not required
# but lets you connect up triples into a graph.

:emp134 vcard:family-name "Smith" .
:emp113 vcard:family-name "Jones" ;
          :reportsTo :emp134 . 

# Objects can be datatypes from the XML Schema part 2 standard or your own
# custom datatypes.

@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
:emp134 vcard:family-name "Smith"^^xsd:string ;  # default data type
          :hireDate "2022-11-12"^^xsd:date ;
          :rating "3.5"^^:someCustomType . 

# The use of schemas with RDF is optional. Schemas may describe all or a
# subset of a dataset. They use a vocabulary described by the W3C RDF Schema
# (RDFS) standard, usually with a prefix of rdfs.

# These schemas are descriptive, to ease the accommodation of new
# datasets, not proscriptive rules about how new data should be 
# created. The following declares a class. (Note that RDFS is itself 
# expressed in triples.)

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> . 
:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .

# The following triple means the same as the preceding one but 
# uses a Turtle shortcut for terseness and more readability.

:Person a rdfs:Class .

# That last triple declares that :Person is an instance of a class, and the
# following declares that employee 113 is an instance of the class Employee.

:emp113 a :Employee . 

# The first triple below is actually unnecessary because a typical
# RDFS processor will infer from the second one that :Employee is a
# class. (Only a subset of RDF parsers perform RDFS inferencing.)

:Employee a rdfs:Class .
:Employee rdfs:subClassOf :Person .

# An RDF parser that reads the last four triples shown and understands
# RDFS will infer that :emp113 is an instance of :Person, because
# it's an instance of :Employee, a subclass of :Person.

# RDFS lets you declare properties and associate them with classes. 
# Properties are first class resources and don't "belong" to classes 
# in the object-oriented sense. rdfs:domain means "the following object 
# class uses the property named by this triple's subject". rdfs:range 
# means "the property named by this triple's subject will have a value of 
# the following class or type". 

:birthday rdf:type rdf:Property ; 
            rdfs:domain :Person ;
            rdfs:range xsd:date .
