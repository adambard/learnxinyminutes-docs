## We need YOU!...

... to contribute in any way you can, from as little as fixing a typo to adding
a whole new tutorial or translating an entire page! Don't worry, it's all very
simple to get started, but we do ask you finish reading the rest of this page
and follow our guidelines. Submit a pull request, and we'll get it reviewed and
merged pronto. For more information, see the guidelines in [Contributing.md](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you would like to contribute but don't know where to start, look for issues
tagged with "quickfix." These tend to be easy fixes you can do in just a few
minutes, nice way to get your feet wet.
