# [Learn X in Y minutes][1]

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs)

Whirlwind tours of (several, hopefully many someday) popular and
ought-to-be-more-popular programming languages, presented as valid, commented
code and explained as they go.

## We need YOU!...

... to write more inline code tutorials. Just grab an existing file from this
repo and copy the formatting (don't worry, it's all very simple). Make a new
file, send a pull request, and if it passes muster I'll get it up pronto.
Remember to fill in the "contributors" fields so you get credited properly!

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome, from the tiniest typo to a brand new article.
Translations in all languages are welcome (or, for that matter, original
articles in any language). Send a pull request or open an issue any time of day
or night.

**Please prepend the tag `[language/lang-code]` to your issues and pull
requests.** For example, `[python/en]` for English Python. This will help
everyone pick out things they care about.

We're happy for any contribution in any form, but if you're making more than one
major change (i.e. translations for two different languages) it would be super
cool of you to make a separate pull request for each one so that someone can
review them more effectively and/or individually.

For a detailed style guide, please review the full [CONTRIBUTING][2] guidelines.

you wish, I guess.
