:: Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
:: 
:: Hello from Docker!
:: This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
:: 
:: To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
:: 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
:: 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
::     (amd64)
:: 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
::     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
:: 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
::     to your terminal.
:: 
:: To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
::  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
:: 
:: Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
::  https://hub.docker.com/
:: 
:: For more examples and ideas, visit:
:: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
