Program Structure

Virtually all structured programs share a similar overall pattern:

    Statements to establish the start of the program
    Variable declaration
    Program statements (blocks of code)



Variable Declaration

Variables are place holders for data a program might use or manipulate. Variables are given names so that we can assign values to them and refer to them later to read the values. Variables typically store values of a given type. Types generally include:

    Integer – to store integer or “whole” numbers
    Real – to store real or fractional numbers (also called float to indicate a floating point number)
    Character – A single character such as a letter of the alphabet or punctuation.
    String – A collection of characters



Boolean Logic and Boolean Algebra

Boolean Algebra was invented by nineteenth century mathematician George Boole. In Boolean Algebra, mathematical expressions are evaluated to one of two values: True or False. Boolean logic is the mathematical logic that is fundamental to Boolean Algebra.

Boolean logic is used throughout computer science. Understanding how to pose and evaluate Boolean logic expressions is a crucial skill for any programmer or indeed anyone who programs computers in a formal language (such as “C”, C++, Java, Pascal, Fortran, SQL, etc.) or in a macro language such as shell scripts or MS Excel formulas and macros.






The Boolean Operators

There are three Boolean operators: AND, OR and NOT.





Comparison Operators

Boolean expressions often involve comparison operators that can be evaluated to determine if they are True or False.
